B2Q: A quantum circuit for converting a bit-based data type into a qubit-based data type


As quantum computers develop, it is necessary to develop a qubit-based quantum algorithm that allows algorithms that used to operate in existing computers to operate in quantum computers. In this process, it is also important to find ways for data itself, such as data movement, storage, and processing from existing computers to quantum computers. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient model B2Q (Bit to Qubit) that brings data from a bit system to data from a qubit system is designed and expressed as a quantum circuit. The proposed model is a data-type conversion algorithm specifically targeting a specific number scheme such as GF(31) used in major cryptographic algorithms, including multivariable quadratic-based quantum-resistant cryptography. The performance of the designed quantum circuit was evaluated in terms of the number of qubits, the number of gates, and the depth, and it was confirmed that the QASM simulator of Qiskit was set to the backend and executed. In addition, we present a scenario in which this B2Q is applied to GF(31)-based addition and signature generation of multivariable quadratic quantum-resistant ciphers.
The process of solving the knapsack problem with QAOA is as fs.
